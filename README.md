### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester.

Term: Spring 2022

+ Projec title: R Notebook Data Story
+ This project is conducted by Jiazheng Chen

+ Project summary: [a short summary] We became interested in the differences between schools in the history of philosophy. From a dataset that contains over 300,000 sentences from over 50 texts spanning 10 major schools of philosophy I want to talk a data story about the direct differences and relationships between these schools. The represented schools are: Plato, Aristotle, Rationalism, Empiricism, German Idealism, Communism, Capitalism, Phenomenology, Continental Philosophy, and Analytic Philosophy.
